## Introductory Text

#### [*Thinking with Type*](https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Type-2nd-revised-expanded/dp/1568989695) by Ellen Lupto
Three chapters: Letters, Text, and Grids. Each chapter starts with theories and follows with practical techniques, a nice blend of both as an intro to typography. I personally find the theory part more intriguing. 
	
#### [*Typographic Systems*](https://www.amazon.com/Typographic-Systems-Design-Kimberly-Elam/dp/1568986874) by Kimberly Elam
Introduces eight typographic systems: axial, radial, dilatational, random, transitional, modular, bilateral, and grid.

#### [*Grid Systems*](https://www.amazon.com/Grid-Systems-Principles-Organizing-Design/dp/1568984650) by Kimberly Elam
Also by Elam, a more detailed account on the grid system.

#### [*Designing with Type*](http://www.designingwithtype.com/) by James Craig and Irene Korol Scala

#### [*Stop Stealing Sheep and Find Out How Type Works*](https://www.amazon.com/Stealing-Graphic-Design-Communication-Courses/dp/0321934288) by Erik Spiekerman
The design of the book is an artwork in itself.


## Classics

#### [*The New Typography*](https://www.amazon.com/New-Typography-Weimar-Now-Criticism/dp/0520250125) by Jan Tschichold (1928)
The book that codified [the New Typography Movement](http://www.designhistory.org/Avant_Garde_pages/DieNeueType.html).

#### [*An Essay on Typography*](https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/196/196147/an-essay-on-typography/9780141393568.html) by Eric Gill (1931)
As much a critique on industrial production as a book on typography. I read it with Postman’s *Technopoly* and there’s an interesting intertextuality.

#### [*Grid Systems in Graphic Design*](https://www.amazon.com/Grid-systems-graphic-design-communication/dp/3721201450) by Josef Muller-Brockmann (1961)
*The* grid book. Mostly on application of grids on editorial and publication design.

#### [*Designing Programmes*](https://www.lars-mueller-publishers.com/designing-programmes-0) by Karl Gerstner (1964)
Could well be the genesis of design system.

#### [*Typography*](https://www.amazon.com/Typographie-Manual-Design-Emil-Ruder/dp/3721200438) by Emil Ruder (1967)

#### [*The Elements of Typographic Style*](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Typographic-Style-Version-Anniversary/dp/0881792128) by Robert Bringhurst (1992)
The all-encompassing essential typography reference. Though at times reads too dry a manual.

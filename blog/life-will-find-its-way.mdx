excerpt: 'A devil’s ivy and its newly sprouted leave.'

I have a devil’s ivy. It has a branch that grows particularly long, hanging down on the table and reaching into the air. The branch keeps growing and has no sign of stopping.

A few days ago, a budding leave on that branch died of thirst—died of my negligence, mostly. I felt sorry being such a terrible plant dad. I tried to made up for it with lots of water. It went from droopy to lively, as I water it every time. I had no idea, however, what would happen to that branch. Will the wilted leave continue to grow somehow? Or will the branch stop growing entirely? (God no!)

This morning when I checked, a new leave sprouted! The wilted part is left as it is, but there’s another new leave branching out—tender, delicate, bright green.

Such a beautiful thing to see. 

Life will always find its way, I guess.

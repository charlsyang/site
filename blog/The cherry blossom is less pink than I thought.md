The Hyperreal Cherry Blossom

The cherry blossom turns out to be less pink than I thought. How come, then, I would have thought it to be much pinker? 

In Chinese slang we sometimes refer photo editing as “P pictures”, where “p” is used as a verb that’s supposed to be short of “photoshop”, meaning to apply some sort of treatment on images, usually with the purpose of making it more appealing—be it food, people, or place.

She reminded me that not long ago I’ve engaged in a similar endeavor to *p* my photos of cherry blossoms.

In a matter of seconds, finger moves and a preset selected—tada, the sky gets bluer and flowers pinker. There you go, an instagram-able photo.

I started asking people: will it get pinker? or is this already as pink as it could get? See, chasing the ghost of . The image constructed is so entrenched that I was still trying to validate it

Which one is real? I can earnestly believe that on the other side of globe there’re much pinker cherry blossoms. a reality weaved by various threads of narratives.

As an (overly) organized person, I  compulsively neat when it comes to photos.
